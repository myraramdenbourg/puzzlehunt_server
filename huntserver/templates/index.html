    <h2>Who are we?</h2>
    <p>
      We are Rice Escape, a group of puzzle enthusiasts from Rice University. We create escape rooms once a semester, with the goal of providing a fun-filled experience to as many members of the
      community as possible. Given covid and social distancing policies this year, we are creating a completely virtual puzzlehunt for the Rice community and puzzle community.
    </p>
    <h2>What is a puzzle hunt?</h2>
    <p>
      Very simply put, it's an event where people get together to solve carefully designed puzzles which somehow link
      together on a larger scale.
      <br>
      A puzzle hunt is typically characterized by its structure. In addition to several normal puzzles, each round has a
      meta-puzzle, which requires teams to have solved most of the normal puzzles to even unlock, and often requires
      solvers to incorporate answers from that round's normal puzzles to make sense of.
      <br>
      Our puzzle hunt's structure changes from semester to semester so as to provide new challenges for solvers.
